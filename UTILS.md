ports and one for UDP ports.

:return: A tuple containing two lists: the first list with open TCP ports and
        the second list with open UDP ports.
:rtype: tuple of (list of tuple, list of tuple)

## find_credentials

parses the output to extract interface names and their corresponding IP addresses, 
and returns this information in a dictionary format. The dictionary keys are
interface names, and the values are IP addresses.

:return: A dictionary where the keys are network interface names and the values
         are their associated IP addresses.
:rtype: dict

## getprompt
Generate a command prompt string with network information and user status.

:param: None

:returns: A string representing the command prompt with network information and user status.

Manual execution:
To manually get a prompt string with network information and user status, ensure you have `get_network_info()` implemented to return a dictionary of network interfaces and their IPs. Then use the function to create a prompt string based on the current user and network info.

Example:
If the function `get_network_info()` returns:
    {
        'tun0': '10.0.0.1',
        'eth0': '192.168.1.2'
    }

And the user is root, the prompt string generated might be:
    [LazyOwn👽10.0.0.1]# 
If the user is not root, it would be:
    [LazyOwn👽10.0.0.1]$ 

If no 'tun' interface is found, the function will use the first available IP or fallback to '127.0.0.1'.

## xor_encrypt_decrypt
Encrypts or decrypts data using XOR encryption with the provided key.

Parameters:
data (bytes or bytearray): The input data to be encrypted or decrypted.
key (str): The encryption key as a string.

Returns:
bytearray: The result of the XOR operation, which can be either the encrypted or decrypted data.

Example:
encrypted_data = xor_encrypt_decrypt(b"Hello, World!", "key")
decrypted_data = xor_encrypt_decrypt(encrypted_data, "key")
print(decrypted_data.decode("utf-8"))  # Outputs: Hello, World!

Additional Notes:
- XOR encryption is symmetric, meaning that the same function is used for both encryption and decryption.
- The key is repeated cyclically to match the length of the data if necessary.
- This method is commonly used for simple encryption tasks, but it is not secure for protecting sensitive information.
